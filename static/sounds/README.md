# Sound Effects

Place your sound effect files here:

- `next.mp3` - Played when advancing to next word
- `funny.mp3` - Played when word is spelled correctly (funny/success sound)
- `fart.mp3` - Played when word is spelled incorrectly (fart noise for laughs!)
- `steal.mp3` - Played when steal is successful

The app will work fine without these files - it will simply skip playing sounds if they don't exist.

You can find free sound effects at:
